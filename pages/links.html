				<li><h3>UX Design</h3></li>
				<li><p>User Experience (UX), according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BdtGjoIN4E">Don Norman</a>, is "... everything that touches upon your experience with the product...". That said, an endeavor that involves <i>everything</i> is hard for one person to do on their own. I'll provide some resources that I found to be super helpful as a budding UX Designer.</p></li>

			<h4><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a></h4>
			<p>One of the leading groups in UX Research and consultancy, Nielsen Norman is a powerhouse for great UX resources, where they provide great articles on ways to improve your design skills. For example, they were one of the few to give clarity on the confusing nature of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/brutalism-antidesign/">Brutalist and Antidesign web trends</a> by clearly defining usable styles vs soley-aesthetic styles.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">Interaction Design Foundation</a></h4>
			<p>The Interaction Design Foundation's website is a great source for references and introductions to the various components of UX Design. There are UX courses available for you to learn from as well as various pieces of curated literature that's open to everyone. If you're willing to take the time and really dig into UX, then the IDF's resources are a veritable treasure trove of information.</p>

			<!--<h4><a href="https://celiahodent.com">Celia Hodent</a></h4>
			<p>Celia Hodent is a former User Experience (UX) Director at Epic Games, known for the Gears of War series and Fornite. She applies cognitive science concepts to game design to strengthen the user experience of games. As a cognitive science major, I love how she has simpified our field's concepts into parsable and understandable modules.</p>-->
			<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/XIpDLa585ao">The Gamer's Brain: How Neuroscience and UX Can Impact Design</a></h4>
			<p>A brilliant presentation by Celia Hodent at the Game Developers Conference in 2015 about how UX Design and Neuroscience can work together to help mitigate biases when designing a game. Though more psychology-leaning, what makes this presentation stand out isn't just the unique combination of UX and Neuro/Psychology, but also how she demonstrates these principles and practices by applying them to various games, some of which she has worked on!</p>
			<h4><a href="https://celiahodent.com/cognitive-psychology-applied-to-user-experience-in-video-games/">Cognitive-Psychology Applied to User Experience in Video Games</a></h4>
			<p>An extension of Hodent's GDC Presentation about UX, Neuroscience, and Games. Originally an entry in the Encyclopedia of Computer Graphics and Games, Hodent provides the reader with more in-depth explanations of how the player's brain works when playing games, as well as plenty of resources for reference. If you're looking for a quick and relatively simple way to understand the brain in terms of games, Celia's paper is for you.</p></li>

			<h3>Game Design Resources</h3>
			<p></p>

			<h4><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/">Gamasutra</a></h4>
			<p>Gamasutra is a website that's all about game development. They are well-known in the video game community and provide an immense amount of resources, from game reviews to helpful articles as well as updated industry news. Users can post blogs about their thoughts on games and there is even a jobs section where companies advertise their open positions.</p>

			<h4><a href="http://www.jamesmathe.com/">James Mathe</a></h4>
			<p>An admin of the Card &amp; Board Game Designers Guild Facebook group, James Mathe gives advice for a variety of game design situations (specifically for board games). My personal favorite article from him is his <a href="http://www.jamesmathe.com/game-design-for-dummies/">Game Design For Dummies</a> article that gives a quick and easy introduction to things such as rule crafting, balancing, etc.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFUZ_uHAWMU44iAlkVoXKnsOefNYdsaK">3 Minute Game Design</a></h4>
			<p>3 Minute Game Design is a series of short videos that deal with many aspects of game design. I find it to be a valuable resource in that it covers more of the theory-side of game design as opposed to the numerous convoluted Youtube tutorials that attempt to teach a software instead of the craft.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/master-of-play">Master of Play</a></h4>
			<p>A wonderful article about the creator of the Legend of Zelda series that discusses how he brought his childhood fascination with exploring nature into the games he made. An important takeaway is that one of the most recognizable game franchises of all time was heavily influenced by the world right around us, driving home the point that designers should draw from their direct environments. A similar sentiment is evident in the creator of Earthbound's <a href="http://earthbound.nintendo.com/message/">message</a> to fans about how the game is like a group of friends letting their imaginations run wild in a playground.</p>

			<h3>Communities</h3>
			<p>Design is not only a problem-solving endeavor, it is a collaborative one as well. Here I will list some active communities that I think are great for connecting with and learning from. No sword or shield required, just an open mind and a friendly attitude. Dont' forget to read the rules!</p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/designguild/">Designers Guild Facebook Group</a></h4>
			<p>Designers Guild is one of many extremely helpful Facebook groups for designers of all sorts to convene and discuss ideas, share resources, etc. That said, the group is for designers only, however there is also a <a href="http://twitter.com/design_guild">twitter</a> account that anyone can interact with. I've benefited greatly from all the great links the various members have shared, as well as engaging with friendly designers willing to lend a hand. If you are a design student, I highly recommend joining this group if you want to have meaningful conversations with professionals.</p>
			
			<h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/">r/gamedesign</a></h4>
			<p>A subreddit dedicated to game design. There's lots of great tools and resources that people share on there everyday. The only downside is that there is no dedicated wiki to organize said tools and resources. Other than that, have fun!<p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/">r/gamedev</a></h4>
			<p>You can't have a video game without programming it, and that's what r/gamedev specializes in. They'll give you everything from programming libraries to sound sample packages, and that's just the start. You'll find all the pieces you need to build your own game here, and they'll be more than happy to help you do so.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare Game Jam</a></h4>
			<p>One of the oldest running game jams on the internet, Ludum Dare invinvites you to make your own game in the span of 1 weekend. Personally, I've seen some terrific games emerge from this event, and I hope you do as well. If you've always wanted to tell your own story in game form, and you have a weekend to spare, why not consider joining?</p>

			<h3>Understanding Game Communities</h3>
			<p>It is often said that to design is to understand people as well as their problems. My belief is that one cannot truly design a great game without first understanding <i>who</i> it is that they are designing for. It would take too much time to delve into this, however what I can do is provide links to papers and articles that are great starting points to understanding the interesting culture of gaming, with all its successes and controversies.</p>

			<h4><a href="http://aas2.asian-studies.org/EAA/EAA-Archives/21/2/1423.pdf">Crafting Stars: South Korean e-Sports and the Emergence of a Digital Gaming Culture</a></h4>
			<p>A great article about the history of e-sports in South Korea by my Computer Game Studies professor, <a href="https://www.stephencrea.com/">Stephen C. Rea</a>. What separates this article from other texts is Stephen's detailed research into a part of Korean history many are not aware of. If you have always wanted to understand the culture and history of e-sports a bit better, then this article is the perfect gateway for you.</p>

			<h4><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.330.6597&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Mudding: Social Phenomena in Text-Based Virtual Realities</a></h4>
			<p>A look back by one Xerox PARC employee at Multi-User Dungeons, specifically at the still-active LambdaMoo. Though a bit removed from the visual-heavy games of recent times, "Mudding" takes a look at a time before games entered the mainstream, and displays some of the same issues that we face today, such as addiction and catfishing.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838151.2014.999917">A Conspiracy of Fishes, or, How We Learned to Stop Worrying About #GamerGate and Embrace Hegemonic Masculinity</a></h4>
			<p>The fascinating story of how 2 researchers were embroiled in the GamerGate controversy as well as the subsequent analysis of sexism in the gaming community. This paper is one of my favorites about toxicity in regards to gender in games because it presents a gripping narrative and acts as a introduction to many other parts of internet culture that contribute to said toxicity.</p>

			<h4><a href="http://nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/pdf/Yee_labor_of_fun.pdf">The Labor of Fun: How Video Games Blur The Boundaries of Work and Play</a></h4>
			<p>This paper takes an interesting approach to analyzing gaming habits and presents long hours put into MMORPG's as similar to those done for work in corporate companies. The author argues that the line between play and work is increasingly disappearing. My personal takeaway from this paper is that as games become more complex, the impicit skills we gain from "practicing" them in-game become more relevant to the real world as well.</p>
