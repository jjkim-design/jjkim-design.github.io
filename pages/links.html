			<h3><a href="https://celiahodent.com">Celia Hodent</a></h3>
			<p>Celia Hodent is a former User Experience (UX) Director at Epic Games, known for the Gears of War series and Fornite. She applies cognitive science concepts to game design to strengthen the user experience of games. As a cognitive science major, I love how she has simpified our field's concepts into parsable and understandable modules.</p>
			<h4><a href="https://youtu.be/XIpDLa585ao">The Gamer's Brain: How Neuroscience and UX Can Impact Design</a></h4>
			<p>A brilliant presentation at the Game Developers Conference in 2015 about how UX Design and Neuroscience can work together to help mitigate biases when designing a game. What makes this presentation stand out isn't just the unique combination of UX and Neuro/Psychology, but also how she demonstrates these principles and practices by applying them to various games, some of which she has worked on!</p>
			<h4><a href="https://celiahodent.com/cognitive-psychology-applied-to-user-experience-in-video-games/">Cognitive-Psychology Applied to User Experience in Video Games</a></h4>
			<p>An extension of Hodent's GDC Presentation about UX, Neuroscience, and Games. Originally an entry in the Encyclopedia of Computer Graphics and Games, Hodent provides the reader with more in-depth explanations of how the player's brain works when playing games, as well as plenty of resources for reference. If you're looking for a quick and relatively simple way to understand the brain in terms of games, Celia's paper is for you.</p>

			<h3>Communities</h3>
			<p>Design is not only a problem-solving endeavor, it is a collaborative one as well. Here I will list some active communities that I think are great for connecting with and learning from. No sword or shield required, just an open mind and a friendly attitude. Dont' forget to read the rules!</p>
			<h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/">r/gamedesign</a></h4>
			<p>A subreddit dedicated to game design. There's lots of great tools and resources that people share on there everyday. The only downside is that there is no dedicated wiki to organize said tools and resources. Other than that, have fun!<p>

			<h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/">r/gamedev</a></h4>
			<p>You can't have a video game without programming it, and that's what r/gamedev specializes in. They'll give you everything from programming libraries to sound sample packages, and that's just the start. You'll find all the pieces you need to build your own game here, and they'll be more than happy to help you do so.</p>

			<h4><a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare Game Jam</a></h4>
			<p>One of the oldest running game jams on the internet, Ludum Dare invinvites you to make your own game in the span of 1 weekend. Personally, I've seen some terrific games emerge from this event, and I hope you do as well. If you've always wanted to tell your own story in game form, and you have a weekend to spare, why not consider joining?</p>

			<h4><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/">Gamasutra</a></h4>
			<p>Gamasutra is a website that's all about game development. They are well-known in the video game community and provide an immense amount of resources, from game reviews to helpful articles as well as updated industry news. Users can post blogs about their thoughts on games and there is even a jobs section where companies advertise their open positions.</p>
